Hello!
I am Adishesh, a student pursuing BTech in Artificial Intelligence at IIT Hyderabad.
I am a beginner in coding, but am enthusiastic to learn programming. I love problem solving.
I discovered github due to my college projects. It is a wonderful site and I hope to build more amazing projects using various languages in the near future.
Currently I am learning c and trying out python, latex(obviously for clg assignments), working on enhancing my programming knowledge.
